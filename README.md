# bikeSales

In this project, I took a large sized data set of Bike Sales that I found online to show my process on creating a walkthrough data cleaning process and presenting a dashboard at the end. Using the raw data you see in the image, below I then copied it to a Working Sheet which I used to create the data I needed for the Dashboard.

                                                                                                                                    ">
The data that I wanted to present was to see if gender, income, education level, and age played a role into customers purchasing a bike. As I was scrolling through the data, I noticed that the ages ranged from 25 years old to 89 years old. To make the visualization process a lot easier to read, I then created a new column "Age Bracket". In this column, I did a nested IF statement to break the age range of customers into 3 categories. If the customer age is less than 31 I put them in the Adolescent Age Bracket, if the customer was greater than or equal to 31 years of age I put them into the Middle Age Bracket, and if the customer was over the age of 54 I put them in the Old Age Bracket.
