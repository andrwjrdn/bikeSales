# bikeSales

In this project, I took a large sized data set of Bike Sales that I found online to show my process on creating a walkthrough data cleaning process and presenting a dashboard at the end. Using the raw data you see in the image, below I then copied it to a Working Sheet which I used to create the data I needed for the Dashboard.

<br>The data that I wanted to present was to make an analyzed assessment on if gender, income, education level, commuting distance or age played a role into customers purchasing a bike. As I was scrolling through the data, I noticed that the ages ranged from 25 years old to 89 years old. To make the visualization process a lot easier to read, I then created a new column "Age Bracket". In this column, I did a nested IF statement to break the age range of customers into 3 categories. If the customer age is less than 31 I put them in the Adolescent Age Bracket, if the customer was greater than or equal to 31 years of age I put them into the Middle Age Bracket, and if the customer was over the age of 54 I put them in the Old Age Bracket.</br>

<br>Before I created a dashboard of the data, I then set up some pivot tables to analyze the numerical data when presenting the dashboard. In these pivot tables I showed the average income for Male and Female, Customer Age Brackets, and Customer Commute Distance.

<br>Finally, I created a Dashboard to visualize and present my data (still a work in progress). I added a few charts and graphs, as well as a few slicers to mess around with to show that the data is being filtered. So far in this unfinished Dashboard a final assessment I concluded was that, people between the ages of 31 and 53 (Middle Age Bracket), and Customers whose commutes were 0-1 miles were more likely to purchase a bike.</br>
